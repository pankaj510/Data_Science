## Model Conclusions
### Part_1:

Yen_forecasting 
- Based on the plots I made, we can see a long-term strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the Dollar. There seems to be 2-4 year consistent trends, but on a daily basis, there are a lot of short-term ups and downs.

Based on the P-Value, was the model a good fit?
- Based on the model table, none of the p-values are under .05, which means that we might need to add additional input variables or adjust the lag order since they are not considered "significant".

- If we were confident with this model's ability to predict, our model forecast for the next 5 days is of positive returns for the Yen.


ARMA model forecasts Japanese Yen in the near term:
- Based on the graph, the price of the Yen is going to rise over the next five days, which is consistent with the findings of our previous model, which forecasted positive returns for the Yen.


Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?

- The risk is increasing and based on that fact, now would not be a great time to buy yen. Yes, I am confident in using these models for trading!


Linear Regression Model 

- The model has a root mean squared error of 0.415% on the out-of-sample data, and a 0.320% on the in-sample-data. Which means the model actually performed better on data that it hasn't seen before.

- We should expect higher error rate on the out of sample data than the in-sample data, since the model is trained to predict the in-sample data as best as it can.
