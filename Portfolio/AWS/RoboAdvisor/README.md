 ROBO_ADVISOR: created in AWS using Lex and Lambda.

 Files included in this folder are for the intent, and slots contained in the zip folders.

 The .mov file is a recording of the RoboAdvisor Bot in action making recommendations based on input from the chat window on the right of the screen. 

I was unable to export the BOT itself without publishing so I have made the video long enough for you to see how the Bot looks.
